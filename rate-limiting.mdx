title: "Rate Limiting"
description: "Understand and work with API rate limits"
---

Every API key has configurable rate limits to protect the platform and ensure fair usage.

## How It Works

Rate limiting uses a **sliding window** algorithm tracked per API key:

- **Per-minute limit** - Maximum requests in any rolling 60-second window
- **Per-day limit** - Maximum requests in any rolling 24-hour window

Both limits are enforced independently. If either is exceeded, requests return `429 Too Many Requests`.

## Rate Limit Headers

Every response includes rate limit information:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests per minute for this key |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Remaining requests in the current minute window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the minute window resets |

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the limit, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Retry after 12 seconds.",
    "details": {
      "retry_after": 12
    }
  }
}
```

The response also includes a `Retry-After` header with the number of seconds to wait.

### Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Respect Retry-After" icon="clock">
    Always wait the number of seconds specified in the `Retry-After` header before retrying.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Exponential Backoff" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">
    If you continue hitting limits, implement exponential backoff with jitter.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Batch Endpoints" icon="layer-group">
    For bulk operations, use batch endpoints (`/ideaclouds/batch`, `/articles/batch`) to reduce request count.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Headers" icon="chart-line">
    Track `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and throttle proactively before hitting the limit.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Default Limits

| Plan | Per Minute | Per Day |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default | 60 | 10,000 |
| Custom | Up to 500 | Up to 100,000 |

Rate limits are configured per API key when creating the key in the Dealership Manager.

## Example: Retry Logic

```javascript
async function apiCallWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);

    if (response.status === 429) {
      const retryAfter = parseInt(response.headers.get('Retry-After') || '5');
      console.log(`Rate limited. Retrying in ${retryAfter}s...`);
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, retryAfter * 1000));
      continue;
    }

    return response;
  }
  throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
}
```
