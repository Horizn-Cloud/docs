description: "How to authenticate with the Hrizn Public API"
---

The Hrizn Public API uses **API keys** for authentication. Each key is tied to a single dealership site, ensuring strict data isolation between tenants.

## Getting an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Dealership Manager">
    In the [Hrizn Dashboard](https://app.hrizn.io), navigate to the dealership you want to integrate with.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to the API tab">
    Click the **API** tab in the dealership settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new key">
    Click **Create API Key**. Configure:
    - **Name** - A descriptive label (e.g. "DSRPTV Production")
    - **Scopes** - Which endpoints the key can access
    - **Rate Limit** - Requests per minute (10-500)
    - **Expiration** - Optional expiry date
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the key">
    The raw key is displayed **once**. Copy and store it securely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Include the key in the `X-API-Key` header:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://public-api.hrizn.io/public/site \
  -H "X-API-Key: hzk_your_key_here"
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://public-api.hrizn.io/public/site', {
  headers: { 'X-API-Key': process.env.HORIZN_API_KEY },
});
const { data } = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://public-api.hrizn.io/public/site',
    headers={'X-API-Key': 'hzk_your_key_here'}
)
data = response.json()['data']
```
</CodeGroup>

## Key Format

API keys follow the format:

```
hzk_<64 hex characters>
```

Example: `hzk_a1b2c3d4e5f67890a1b2c3d4e5f67890a1b2c3d4e5f67890a1b2c3d4e5f67890`

The first 12 characters (`hzk_a1b2c3d4`) are stored as the **key prefix** and visible in the dashboard for identification.

## Key Security

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Storage** | Keys are SHA-256 hashed before storage. Hrizn never stores raw keys. |
| **Display** | The raw key is returned exactly once at creation time. |
| **Revocation** | Keys can be revoked instantly from the dashboard. |
| **Expiration** | Keys can have optional expiry dates (30, 90, 180, 365 days). |
| **Isolation** | Each key is bound to a single dealership site. |
| **Rate Limits** | Each key has independent per-minute and per-day rate limits. |
