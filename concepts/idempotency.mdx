POST requests that create resources support idempotency keys to prevent duplicate operations when retrying failed requests.

## How it works

Include an `X-Idempotency-Key` header with a unique string (up to 256 characters). If the same key is sent again within 24 hours, the API returns the original response instead of creating a duplicate.

```bash
curl -X POST https://public-api.hrizn.io/public/ideaclouds \
  -H "X-API-Key: hzk_your_key_here" \
  -H "X-Idempotency-Key: create-ideacloud-2026-02-10-crv-review" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "keyword": "2025 Honda CR-V reviews" }'
```

## When to use it

Use idempotency keys on any POST request that triggers a side effect:

- Creating IdeaClouds
- Creating articles
- Triggering compliance checks
- Triggering content tools generation
- Triggering description generation

GET, PATCH, and DELETE requests are naturally idempotent and do not need this header.

## Key format

Use any string that uniquely identifies the intended operation. Common patterns:

| Pattern | Example |
| --- | --- |
| UUID | `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` |
| Action + timestamp | `create-article-2026-02-10T12:00:00Z` |
| External reference | `dsrptv-order-12345` |

## Conflict detection

If you reuse an idempotency key with **different request parameters**, the API returns `409 Conflict`:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "idempotency_conflict",
    "message": "Idempotency key reused with different parameters"
  }
}
```

## Expiration

Idempotency keys expire after **24 hours**. After that, the same key can be reused with any parameters.
