Subscribe to events by providing a URL that will receive `POST` requests when events occur. Each webhook is signed with HMAC-SHA256 for verification.

**Scope required:** `webhooks:write`

## Request body

<ParamField body="url" type="string" required>
  HTTPS endpoint URL that will receive webhook payloads.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="events" type="array" required>
  List of event types to subscribe to. See [Webhook events](/api-reference/reference/webhook-events) for all options.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="description" type="string">
  Optional description for this subscription.
</ParamField>

## Response

Returns the subscription details including the signing `secret`. Save this secret - it is only shown once.

<ResponseExample>
```json 201
{
  "data": {
    "id": "wh-uuid-123",
    "url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/horizn",
    "events": ["article.completed", "ideacloud.completed"],
    "description": "Content pipeline webhook",
    "secret": "whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2026-02-10T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<Warning>
  Save the `secret` value immediately. It is only returned when the webhook is created and cannot be retrieved later. You will need it to verify incoming webhook signatures.
</Warning>
