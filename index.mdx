## Core Workflow

The typical integration flow follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an IdeaCloud">
    Send a keyword or topic to start research. The IdeaCloud gathers questions, clusters them by intent, and identifies the best angles for content.

    ```bash
    POST /ideaclouds
    { "keyword": "2025 Honda CR-V vs Toyota RAV4" }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate an Article">
    Once the IdeaCloud is complete, create an article from it. Choose the article type and optionally select specific questions to cover.

    ```bash
    POST /articles
    {
      "ideacloud_id": "...",
      "article_type": "comparison",
      "auto_compliance": true,
      "auto_content_tools": true
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the Content">
    Poll for status or use webhooks to know when generation completes. Then retrieve the full HTML, structured data, and metadata.

    ```bash
    GET /articles/{id}/html
    GET /articles/{id}/components
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
